Day 21 – [14th July 2025]

TOPICS COVERED
Searching and Modifying Records in SQLite3 via Tkinter GUI The day centered around building search and edit functionalities for database records using a form-style interface in Tkinter. Applied condition-based retrieval and implemented real-time updates through user inputs.

Programs Practiced
1. Searching for Employee Data by ID Designed a GUI to retrieve an employee’s name by entering their ID. On clicking the search button, the app queried the emp table and displayed the result in an entry field.
Key Concepts Applied:
•	Parameterized query with SELECT * FROM emp WHERE Id = ?.
•	Used fetchone() to retrieve a single matching record.
•	Printed row[1] to extract and display only the employee name.
•	Cleared and reset the search field after execution using .delete() and .focus_set().
2. Searching and Modifying Employee Records Extended functionality by adding a MODIFY button that updates an employee's name based on the entered ID. Provided dual interaction:
•	SEARCH: Retrieves name for entered ID.
•	MODIFY: Updates name using input from both fields.
New Concepts Introduced:
•	UPDATE emp SET Name = ? WHERE Id = ? – Performs record modification.
•	Error-handling logic to manage incorrect or missing ID inputs.
•	GUI built using Label, Entry, and Button widgets with place() for layout positioning.

Key Learnings of the Day
•	Gained proficiency in querying records by ID using GUI elements.
•	Implemented live updates to database entries with clean user feedback.
•	Practiced clearing and resetting inputs post-action to improve usability.
•	Strengthened understanding of two-way database interaction—fetching and updating records via form logic.
