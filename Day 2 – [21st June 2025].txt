Day 2 – [21st June 2025]

TOPICS COVERED
Introduction to Basic Tkinter Programs Explored Tkinter, Python’s standard GUI library for desktop applications. Focused on initializing windows, adding widgets, and integrating basic visual components like text and images.

Programs Practiced
1. Creating a Basic Empty Window Started by creating a minimal GUI window using Tkinter to understand the foundation of every application.
Functions Used:
•	Tk() – Creates the main window.
•	mainloop() – Keeps the window active and responsive.
2. Displaying a Simple Text Label Learned how to display static text using the Label widget and managed its layout using the pack() method.
Functions Used:
•	Label() – Used to show text.
•	pack() – Automatically arranges widgets in blocks.
3. Displaying an Image in a Tkinter Window Added a .gif image into the GUI using PhotoImage and embedded it into a label for display.
Functions Used:
•	PhotoImage() – Loads image files compatible with Tkinter.
•	Label() – Holds and shows the image.
•	pack() – Positions the image within the window.

Key Learnings of the Day
•	Understood how a GUI window is initialized and sustained.
•	Practiced creating and placing widgets like text labels and images.
•	Learned how layout management works with the pack() geometry manager.
•	Set up the groundwork for building functional interfaces using Tkinter.
