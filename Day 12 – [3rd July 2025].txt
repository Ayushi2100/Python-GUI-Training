Day 12 – [3rd July 2025]

TOPICS COVERED
Interactive GUI Controls with Scales and Listboxes in Tkinter Today’s session focused on integrating slider-based numeric input and list-style widgets. Explored scale configuration for dynamic value selection and used listboxes to display selectable text items. Strengthened understanding of layout control, value retrieval, and visual structuring.

Programs Practiced
1. Creating Vertical and Horizontal Scale Widgets Designed two scale widgets to allow users to select numbers from specified ranges. Practiced orientation control and setting default values.
New Widget Introduced:
•	Scale() – Enables graphical input of numeric values via sliders.
New Attributes Applied:
•	orient=HORIZONTAL – Sets horizontal layout.
•	.set() – Initializes default slider value.
2. Retrieving Scale Values with Custom Ticks and Lengths Enhanced scale widgets with labeled tick intervals and adjusted slider length. Added a button to retrieve and display selected values.
New Attributes Applied:
•	tickinterval – Creates labeled increments on the scale.
•	length – Controls the size of the horizontal slider.
•	.get() – Retrieves current value of a scale widget.
3. Displaying Programming Languages with a Listbox Populated a listbox with various programming language names. Learned to add items into specific positions and present a scrollable vertical list.
New Widget Introduced:
•	Listbox() – Displays a scrollable selection list.
•	.insert(index, item) – Adds items to the list at specified positions.
4. Appending Items to a Listbox with a Loop Designed a dynamic listbox that starts with a default “Select” option and appends new items using a loop. Practiced using END to add items sequentially and refined listbox population strategies.
New Concept Applied:
•	insert(END, item) – Adds items to the end of the listbox.
•	for loop – Automates item insertion from a list.

Key Learnings of the Day
•	Gained hands-on experience with scale widgets for flexible numeric input.
•	Customized scale appearance and functionality using tick intervals and lengths.
•	Practiced listbox usage for presenting options and populating content dynamically.
